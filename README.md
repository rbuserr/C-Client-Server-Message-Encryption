# C-Client-Server-Message-Encryption
Client: This application sends encrypted messages to the server. It waits for the server’s response and decrypts it before displaying. Server: This application listens for incoming client connections, receives encrypted messages, decrypts them, and sends back a response that is also encrypted. The encryption is using a simple XOR operation
 Introduction
In today’s digital world, secure communication is vital. The client-server architecture serves as the backbone of many applications, allowing data exchange between different systems. This document presents a simple C++ implementation of a client-server system that encrypts messages using the XOR method, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential during transmission.
 System Overview
The system consists of two main components:
Client: This application sends encrypted messages to the server. It waits for the server’s response and decrypts it before displaying.
Server: This application listens for incoming client connections, receives encrypted messages, decrypts them, and sends back a response that is also encrypted.
The encryption is performed using a simple XOR operation, which is a basic yet effective method for secure communication.


    Explanation: The client code creates a socket, connects to the server, and enters a loop where it accepts user input. Each message is encrypted using the XOR operation with a key ('K') before being sent to the server. The client then waits for the server’s response, which is printed to the console.


    Explanation: The server code creates a listening socket and waits for client connections. When a client connects, it spawns a new thread to handle communication. The server receives encrypted messages, decrypts them, and sends back an encrypted response.

Setting Up the Environment
To run the code, ensure you have the following software installed:
A C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
Development environment (Linux or macOS recommended for POSIX support).
Installation Instructions:
For Linux: You can install the build-essential package if it's not already installed:                -sudo apt-get install build-essential
For macOS: Install Xcode command line tools:                                                              -xcode-select --install

Running the Code
Compiling the Code
Save the client code in a file named client.cpp.
Save the server code in a file named server.cpp.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing these files.
Compile both files:
g++ client.cpp -o client 
g++ server.cpp -o server
      Running the Code
Start the server first: ./server                                                                                                        You should see "Server listening on port 8080..."
In another terminal window, run the client:                                                                                  -./client
Enter messages when prompted. Type 'exit' to close the client.
      Example Interaction
Server Output:
Server listening on port 8080...
Client connected.
Client says: Hello
Client says: How are you?


Client Output:
Enter message (type 'exit' to quit): Hello
Server response (encrypted): [Encrypted message]
Enter message (type 'exit' to quit): How are you?
Server response (encrypted): [Encrypted message]

Conclusion
This C++ client-server application demonstrates the fundamentals of network communication and message encryption. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing secure applications. While the XOR encryption method is simple and effective for demonstration purposes, consider using more robust encryption algorithms in production systems.
