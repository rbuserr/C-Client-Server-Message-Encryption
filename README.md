# C-Client-Server-Message-Encryption
Client: This application sends encrypted messages to the server. It waits for the serverâ€™s response and decrypts it before displaying. Server: This application listens for incoming client connections, receives encrypted messages, decrypts them, and sends back a response that is also encrypted. The encryption is using a simple XOR operation
